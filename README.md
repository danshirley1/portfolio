# Portfolio

A personal showcase portfolio demonstrating a range of techniques and technologies.

## NOTE DS 10/10/18

A lot of this early work is experimental, so I've been lazy with commit messages etc. This readme is for my use really but am keeping the repo public for, well, no reason.

A v0.0.1 will be cut soon to tidy things up.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) at v1.1.5 (25/8/2018).

The Node server was created by adapting the tutorial:
https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/

## Install
```
npm i && cd client && npm i && cd ../server && npm i && cd..
```

## To run locally

```
npm start
```

To restart server back-end (until I work out how to make it 'hot'):

```
npm start
```

## What is it?
An opportunity to demonstrate my technical skills, by presenting various aspects of my development experience all in one place.

## Why?
Primarily, so future clients have an environment where they can gain full and transparent understanding of what I can offer them. Also it's a great way to learn and apply new technolgies as a evolving, contigous piece of work.

## Roadmap
### Layout and Base Content
The first step is to create a well formed web page with a base level of content, this will showcase good markup/ styling discipline. The features demonstrated in this phase will include:
- Grid based responsive layout
- Atomic design
- OOCSS/ SMACS/ SASS
- View Templating
- Task Runners, Bundlers, build tools

### Single Page App
Moving on I'll pick up some frameworks and have the site run as a SPA. Ultimately I want the user to be able to switch between different builds of the site, where options will be taken from a list:
- React
- Angular (v4+)
- Node/ Express
- PHP
- Database View Templating (Firebase etc.)

### Back-end Features
I'll create some data-driven widgets to add to the site, exciting things that I either create myself or utilise though libraries/ APIs.

This project is a personal website/portfolio starter. It includes all of the boilerplate code necessary for setting up React with Webpack, and has a beautiful, responsive design:
