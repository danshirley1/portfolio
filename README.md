# Showcase Portfolio
A personal showcase portfolio demonstrating a range of techniques and technologies.

## What is it?
An opportunity to demonstrate my technical skills, by presenting various aspects of my development experience all in one place.

## Why?
Primarily, so future clients have an environment where they can gain full and transparent understanding of what I can offer them. Also it's a great way to learn and apply new technolgies as a evolving, contigous piece of work.

## Roadmap
### Layout and Base Content
The first step is to create a well formed web page with a base level of content, this will showcase good markup/ styling discipline. The features demonstrated in this phase will include:
- Grid based responsive layout
- Atomic design
- OOCSS/ SMACS/ SASS
- View Templating
- Task Runners, Bundlers, build tools

### Single Page App
Moving on I'll pick up some frameworks and have the site run as a SPA. Ultimately I want the user to be able to switch between different builds of the site, where options will be taken from a list:
- React
- Angular (v4+)
- Node/ Express
- PHP
- Database View Templating (Firebase etc.)

### Back-end Features
I'll create some data-driven widgets to add to the site, exciting things that I either create myself or utilise though libraries/ APIs.

This project is a personal website/portfolio starter. It includes all of the boilerplate code necessary for setting up React with Webpack, and has a beautiful, responsive design:
